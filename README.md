# ðŸ’» The Morality Lab: Coding Challenge

Welcome, and thank you so much for your interest in our lab! Here, you will find all the materials for your Python, R, and MATLAB coding challenges. All data is located in the `data` folder, and all scripts are located in the `scripts` folder.

## Question 1: Python Coding Challenge
*    To simplify the process of getting started, we will not ask you to download Python or any of its dependencies; instead, simply click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/lypsychlab/coding-challenge/blob/main/scripts/q1.ipynb) to open up the challenge as a Colab workbook in Google Drive (this will automatically save a personal copy of the file in your Drive).
*    Once you are done debugging the script, please download the workbook as an `.ipynb` file and upload it into the Qualtrics submission survey.

## Question 2: MATLAB Coding Challenge
*    Please download the standalone script [here](https://github.com/lypsychlab/coding-challenge/blob/main/scripts/q2.m).
*    Please note that you **cannot** run this code.
*    Once you are done debugging the script, please upload it as a `.m` file to Qualtrics.

## Question 3: R Coding Challenge
*    If you do not already have R installed, please navigate [here](https://cran.r-project.org/) to download it for PC or Mac.
*    If you do not already have the RStudio IDE installed, please [download](https://posit.co/downloads/) it from the Posit website.
*    Please download the script, `q3.Rmd`, [here](https://github.com/lypsychlab/coding-challenge/blob/main/scripts/q3.Rmd) and open it in RStudio.
*    Please also download the data locally for this challenge from this [link](https://github.com/lypsychlab/coding-challenge/blob/main/data/q3_data.csv).
*    Once you have filled in the missing code in the R notebook, please upload it as a `.Rmd` file to Qualtrics.
